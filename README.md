**With Claude Sonnet 3.5 released, I'm on the verge of abandoning work on this project. Breaking down complext tasks into subtasks for AI may not be necessary anymore!**

This app will create a python virtual environment for you and create files for your prompted tasks and any subtasks that AI generates for you.

The default implementation is Google's free Gemini API model.

1. Create or open a project.
2. Create or open your first file.
3. Enter a prompt for a complex code writing task for AI to complete.
5. Modify and submit subtask prompts.
6. Execute code responses from AI.
7. Save subtask code as new files.
8. Include any generated code for subtasks in remaining subtasks.

TODO:
1. Combine subtask output into other remaining subtasks.
2. Execute a final task of combining all subtasks into one.
